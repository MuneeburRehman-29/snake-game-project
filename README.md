# Simple Raylib Ball Game
A small C++ game made using Raylib.
You control a white ball that moves around the screen, wraps around the edges, and eats a red food circle that respawns randomly.

This project is perfect for beginners learning:
1. window creation
2.drawing shapes
3. movement handling
4. collisions
5. randomness

How to Use This Project

Open the project by double-clicking main.code-workspace.

From VS Code’s Explorer, open src/main.cpp.

Press F5 to build and run the game.

Watch the explanation video included in the project folder.

Features

Smooth 59 FPS rendering

Arrow-key movement

Keeps moving until new direction chosen

Screen wrap-around (Pac-Man style)

Random food generation

Collision detection using distance formula

How to Compile Manually (Optional)

Windows + MinGW + Raylib:

g++ main.cpp -o game -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm


Then run:

./game

# Code Explanation

Everything below explains how the program works, part by part.

1. Includes
#include <raylib.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>


raylib.h → graphics, window, drawing, input

stdlib.h → randomness functions

time.h → seeding the random generator

math.h → square root for detecting collision distances

2. Window + Player Setup
const int screenWidth = 810;
const int screenHeight = 900;
int BallX = screenWidth / 2;
int BallY = screenHeight / 2;
char key = 'Z';


Creates the window size, centers the player, and stores movement direction.

Colors:

Color black = {0, 0, 0, 255};
Color white = {255, 255, 255, 255};
Color red   = {255, 73, 92, 255};


Player and food sizes:

int playerRadius = 20;
int foodRadius = 10;

3. Window Initialization
InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "first game window by umais using raylib");
SetTargetFPS(59);
srand(time(NULL));


Creates the game window

Sets smooth frame rate

Seeds random numbers

4. Food Spawn
do {
    foodX = rand() % screenWidth;
    foodY = rand() % screenHeight;
} while (foodX == BallX && foodY == BallY);


Makes sure food never spawns on top of the player.

Main Game Loop
while (!WindowShouldClose()) {


Runs until the user closes the window.

5. Movement Input
if (IsKeyDown(KEY_RIGHT)) key = 'R';
if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT))  key = 'L';
if (IsKeyDown(KEY_UP))    key = 'U';
if (IsKeyDown(KEY_DOWN))  key = 'D';


Direction updates only when a new key is pressed.

6. Move Player
if (key == 'R') BallX += 5;
if (key == 'L') BallX -= 5;
if (key == 'U') BallY -= 5;
if (key == 'D') BallY += 5;


Moves the ball 5 pixels each frame.

7. Screen Wrap-Around
if (BallX > screenWidth)  BallX = 0;
if (BallX < 0)            BallX = screenWidth;
if (BallY > screenHeight) BallY = 0;
if (BallY < 0)            BallY = screenHeight;


If the ball leaves one edge, it appears on the opposite side.

8. Collision Detection
float dx = BallX - foodX;
float dy = BallY - foodY;
float distance = sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);


Standard distance formula from geometry.

If touching:

if (distance <= playerRadius + foodRadius) {
    // respawn food
}


Food respawns randomly.

9. Drawing
BeginDrawing();
ClearBackground(black);
DrawCircle(foodX, foodY, foodRadius, red);
DrawCircle(BallX, BallY, playerRadius, white);
EndDrawing();


Clears screen

Draws food

Draws player

Runs every frame.

10. Cleanup
CloseWindow();
return 0;


Shuts down the window and ends the program.
